       " 'reviews': ['I had an older Galaxy Tab A (2019), but a friend broke it. Android tablet computers have really improved since I bought the old Samsung.\\nI have a Samsung laptop and smartphone; they connect seamlessly and transferring data and media is a breeze.\\nI knew the new tablet would be another Samsung.\\nWhat I was unprepared for was how much I LOVE this Galaxy Tab A9+ (2024 version). The A9+ was released in 2023 and 2024. The latter has an improved chipset (Snapdragon) and is updated to Android 14. Otherwise, they are identical.\\nThe A9+ has an 11\" screen and is lightweight and thin enough to put a cover on and carry in my handbag.\\nThe display is bright, smooth and videos look beautiful. I have already used it for virtual meetings. Games run perfectly (though I will say up front that I don\\'t run any graphics-intensive games).\\nThis tablet has checked all the boxes for my needs.\\nAnd get this: for the 64gb model, I paid just $159.00, brand new.\\nI cannot imagine how many bells and whistles are packed into tablets costing ten times more, especially when the A9 is everything I could ask for.\\nI will continue to attend virtual meetings, as well as journaling and some digital art.\\nI added an active stylus for the art; it\\'s a great combo!\\nSo far. I\\'ve encountered no negative attributes.\\nIf you want a great little tablet for general computing and don\\'t want to spend a fortune, don\\'t hesitate trying the Galaxy Tab A9+.\\nThis tablet would make a fantastic gift!',\n",
       "  \"This tablet is awesome!! Beautiful display, especially great for streaming movies and shows. It was super easy to set up. The charging didn't take more than 2 hours (using a 45W charging block that I ordered separately). Sound is plenty good, but is absolutely GREAT with the JBL earphones I ordered separately. And YES! This tablet has a JACK for my earphones to plug in! That was huge on my list, so I can watch shows during lunch at work. Battery lasts at least 8 hours, maybe more, if mostly streaming. Get this tablet!\",\n",

Agradeço pela compra pq com certeza valeu muito a pena']}"
